## The main menu

It's hard to miss SIMS's main menu.  But in case you did, it's the bright pink button, top left of the app.

Using the menu's search, it's easy to find the screen you need.

To find screens:

1. Open the **Menu**.
2. Type the name of the screen into the **Menu Search**.

## Frequently used

For quick access to screens you use often, we list them in the **Frequently Used** panel.

{% include image.html url="shots/frequentlyused.png" title="Frequently Used" %}

 The more often you use a screen, the higher up the list it'll appear.

## Menu organisation

The menu groups screens into 'functional' areas. These groupings help you when your task involves several screens. E.g., managing your pastoral structure.

> If the menu item has extra information, you can hover over the **Help Symbol** {% include icon.html url="question-circle" title="Search" %}.

## Quick Links

**Quick Links** are shortcuts to regularly used screens.

{% include image.html url="shots/quick-links.png" title="The **Quick Links**" %}

## Multitasking

To help you switch between your current activities, we keep your current screens open as **Tabs** at the bottom of the screen.

{% include image.html url="shots/tabs.png" title="The **Tabs**" %}
