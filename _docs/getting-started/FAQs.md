{% include faq.html explain="How do I change the date to **UK format**" %}

If the dates in SIMS aren't displaying in the UK format, i.e. dd/MM/yyyy, then *probably* your browser or operating system's **Language and Region** settings are set to US English.

Changing the **Language and Region** settings depend upon your browser and operating system. 

Try googling to find how to change your settings:
