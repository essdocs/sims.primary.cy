## Opening the Pupil List Export and Print screen

1. Open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu" %}.
2. Use the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu Search" %} to find **Pupil List Export and Print**.
3. Use the **Search** panel to select your class or year group.

Add or remove columns by turning them on or off in the  **Pupil Info Columns** {% include icon.html url="pupilrecord" title="Pupil Info Columns" %} panel.

{% include faq.html explain="Sorting and grouping" %}

You can sort the pupils by any column on the screen, e.g., you can sort pupils by their gender, class, disability.

> You may want to sort by more than one column to group your pupils. E.g., you might want to order your pupils by class, then by gender.
{:.tip}

To apply sorting, click the **Sort into Groups** {% include icon.html url="sort-alpha-asc" title="Ascending" %} on the toolbar.

{% include faq-end.html %}

{% include faq.html explain="Filtering" %}

You can use any column on the screen as a filter, e.g., you can focus on the pupils eligible for Pupil Premium.

> You can also filter by more than one column. By applying multiple filters, you can customise your list to show a specific set of pupils.
{:.tip}

To apply a filter, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %} and choose your filter options from the **Filter** panel.

You can see if a filter is applied to a column by the icon shown in the column heading:

* A drop-down arrow {% include icon.html url="caret-down" title="Down Arrow" %} means no filtering is applied.
* A filter icon {% include icon.html url="filter" title="Filter" %}  means that a filter is applied.
