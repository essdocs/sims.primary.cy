title: Early year provision
---

> Schools with a dedicated nursery unit, that offer early years care, must
present parents of three to four year olds with the choice of varying nursery
hours on any day of the week.

Parents are now entitled to receive 15 hours of free nursery provision per
week, which can be taken over a minimum of three days. They can choose to
take as much or as little of the 15 hours, and use their entitlement at more
than one nursery provider, if they wish.
Attendance Setup includes the facility to define Early Years Provisions, from
which Early Years Attendance patterns can be created for applicable applicants
and pupils, in order to calculate Hours at Setting for nursery age pupils, for
School Census purposes.
