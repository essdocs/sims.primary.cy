## What is the Pupil Log?

The **Pupil Log** is a rolling narrative about what’s going on with a pupil in school.

The **Pupil Log** pulls together the information you need to understand your pupils and their overall performance better.

With **Pupil Log** notes, you can capture thoughts, pictures, and evidence often written on post-its, notebooks or pupil diaries. 

Use the **Pupil Log** when talking about a pupil’s progress or when writing reports for parents.

## Pupil Log notes

**Pupil Log** notes give you a way to capture more context and narrative about a child's life in school. The things often missed.

You can record notes on the **Pupil Log** screen, but typically you'll add notes when working on other screens in SIMS. E.g. you can add notes while on:

* Pupil Record
* [General Marksheets](../assessment/marksheets/ms-ass)
* [Programme of Study Tracking Marksheets](../assessment/marksheets/ms-pos)
* [Edit Marks](../../schoolmanagement/attendance/edit-marks)
* [Class Log](../clog/)
