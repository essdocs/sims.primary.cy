Marksheets display the latest results by default.

You can view, add, amend or delete the result history for a pupil by choosing the cell and clicking the **Edit Result History** {% include icon.html url="history" title="Edit Result History" %} button.

Unless you're an Assessment Coordinator, you can only delete results that you've entered yourself.
