{% include faq.html explain="Hiding and showing columns" %}

Marksheets can get large in some schools. Hiding columns can help you focus on the most relevant assessments, e.g., focus on the year to Autumn term, or a specific subject.

To hide (or show) **Data Entry** columns, open the **Filter Columns By** panel on the toolbar.

{% include image.html url="shots/ass-filter-columns.png" title="Column filtering" %}

We show the applied filters in the toolbar. 

{% include image.html url="shots/ass-filtered.png" title=" Column filtering by the assessment period *Year 2 Annual* and the subject *English*" %}

{% include faq.html explain="Data entry" %}

You can enter results into the marksheet with your keyboard. Or, use the [Result Picker](result-picker).

{% include faq-end.html  %}

## Analysis

The marksheet has tools to help you see if pupils are excelling, or falling behind. You can use this information to focus your support.

{% include faq.html explain="Summary Panel" %}

At the bottom of the marksheet is the **Summary** panel.

From the **Summary** panel, you get an overview of the grades entered, and the mean and median grades.

By default, we hide the **Summary** panel. To see the summary, click the **Summary** button at the bottom of the marksheet.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Additional pupil information" %}

You can add additional pupil information to the marksheet for more context. E.g., if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

Add or remove the pupil information columns by clicking **Pupil Info Columns** {% include icon.html url="pupilrecord" title="Pupil Info Columns" %} on the toolbar.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Sorting" %}

You can sort by any column on the marksheet. E.g., you can sort on the pupils by their results.

{% include faq.html explain="Filtering" %}

You can use any column on the marksheet as a filter. E.g., you can focus on the pupils eligible for Pupil Premium.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Adding Ad-hoc Columns" %}

You can add ad-hoc columns to a marksheet. E.g., if you decide to challenge the class to a quick spelling test and you want to record the outcome.

To add a column:

1. Click **Add My Column** on the toolbar.
2. Give the column a name.
3. Set the column type to either **Text** or **Number**.

> The additional column only affects *your* marksheet. If you need a column adding to every marksheet, you need to change the marksheet's template. You'll need to ask your Assessment Coordinator to do this for you.
