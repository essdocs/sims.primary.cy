## Analysis

The tracking sheet has tools to help you see if pupils are excelling, or falling behind. Use this information to focus your support.

{% include faq.html explain="Expectations achieved" %}

The tracking sheet shows you the percentage of pupils meeting both the DfE and schools expectations. The percentage shows how many targeted skills are assessed as Secured or higher.

If  you can't see the **Expectations** columns, open the **Show Me** panel on the toolbar, and turn on the **Summary Columns**.

{% include image.html url="shots/pos-show-me.png" title="The **Show Me** menu" %}

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Summary panel" %}

At the bottom of the tracking sheet, is the **Summary** panel.

From the **Summary** panel, you can see the number and percentage of pupils mastering, achieving, or aren't achieving a skill.

The calculations are based on how many pupils are attaining the Secured grade or higher.

By default, we hide the **Summary** panel. To see the summary, click the **Summary** button at the bottom of the tracking sheet.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Grade distribution" %}

You can see the grade distribution for your class by changing the **Marksheet View** from **Spreadsheet** {% include icon.html url="table" title="Spreadsheet" %} to **Analysis** {% include icon.html url="bar-chart" title="Analysis View" %} on the toolbar.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Additional pupil information" %}

You can add additional pupil information to the tracking sheet for more context. E.g., if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

Add or remove the pupil information columns by clicking **Pupil Info Columns** {% include icon.html url="pupilrecord" title="Pupil Info Columns" %} on the toolbar.
