title: Sorting marksheets
---

You can sort by any column on the marksheet. E.g., you can sort on the pupils by their results.

To apply sorting, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %}, and click  **Sort Ascending** {% include icon.html url="sort-alpha-asc" title="Ascending" %} or **Sort Descending** {% include icon.html url="sort-alpha-desc" title="Ascending" %}.

> You can only sort by one column at a time.
