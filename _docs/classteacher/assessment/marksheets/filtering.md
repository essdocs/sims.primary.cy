title: Filtering markheets
---

You can use any column on the marksheet as a filter. E.g., you can focus on the pupils eligible for Pupil Premium.

> You can filter by more than one column. By applying multiple filters, you can focus your attention on a particular group of pupils.
{:.tip}

To apply filters, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %}, and choose your filter options from the **Filter** panel.

You can see if a filter is applied to a column by the icon shown in the column heading:

* A drop-down arrow {% include icon.html url="caret-down" title="Down Arrow" %} means no filtering is applied.
* A filter icon {% include icon.html url="filter" title="Filter" %}  means that a filter is applied.
