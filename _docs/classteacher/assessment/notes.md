title: Viewing and adding notes
---

You can add, amend or delete notes on a pupil's results by choosing the cell and clicking the **Edit Note** {% include icon.html url="comment-o" title="Edit Note" %} button.

E.g., you can record why a result was changed or why their performance wasn't as expected (poor health, bereavement)

The indicator in the top right of a cell highlights if there's a note recorded for a pupil.
