Assessment simplified.
{:.lead}

A marksheet is a spreadsheet, listing pupils in rows, and the assessments in columns ({% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Aspects" %}).

In SIMS there are three types of marksheet:

1. [General Marksheets](marksheets/ms-ass), used for {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Summative" %} assessments, e.g., the end of Key Stage assessment.
2. [Programme of Study Tracking Sheets](marksheets/ms-pos), used for ongoing {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Formative" %} evaluation; where you assess against curriculum learning objectives.
3. [Historical Marksheets](marksheets/ms-historical), used for changing results in the past.

{% include faq.html explain="Marksheet creation" %}

An Assessment Coordinator creates Marksheets.

An Assessment Coordinator creates templates for a marksheet, i.e. the columns to appear in marksheets.

By associating the template with one or more groups, e.g., classes, year groups, marksheets are created.

As a teacher, you'll see only those marksheets relevant to you.

{% include faq.html explain="Column types" %}

Several column types make up a marksheet:

Data entry columns
: Data entry columns are for entering the results.

Read-only columns
: Read-only columns are for information. Read-only columns appear greyed-out and can't be edited.

Formula columns
: A formula column performs calculations on the data in your marksheet.

Formula columns are indicated by an {% include icon.html url="formula-function" title="Formula Icon" %} symbol in the column header.

To see details on a formula, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %} and click {% include icon.html url="formula" title="Take Formula" %} **View Formula**.

Pupil information columns
: Pupil information columns contain information about a pupil, e.g., their name, class, year group.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Additional information" %}

You can add additional pupil information to the marksheet for more context. E.g. if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

Add or remove the pupil information columns by clicking **Pupil Info Columns** {% include icon.html url="pupilrecord" title="Pupil Info Columns" %} on the toolbar.

Clicking on a pupil's name shows you **Pupil Info** panel, such as their photo, and date of birth.

{% include image.html url="shots/ms-additional.png" title="Click the pupil's name for their **Pupil Info** panel" %}

From the **Pupil Info** panel, you can also create [Pupil Log Notes](../plog/)

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Result Types" %}

There are five Result Types:

1. Grade
2. Mark (integer)
3. Mark (decimal)
4. Age
5. Comment

{% include faq.html explain="Result History" %}

As you enter results into a marksheet, we store the previous result. Recording the result history helps you analyse your pupil's progress.
