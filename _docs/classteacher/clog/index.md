Designed for the classroom, the Class Log is a new way for you to interact with information on your class.
{:.lead}

Many of your daily tasks can be made easier with the Class Log:

* [Taking the register](take-register)
* [Recording lunches](dinner-register)
* [Award conduct points](conduct)
* [Recording notes](notes)

## Opening the Class Log

1. Open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu" %}.
2. Use the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu Search" %} to find **Class Log**.
3. Choose your class.

> For teachers, there's a shortcut to **Class Log** in the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Quick Links" %}.

{% include faq.html explain="Filter By panel" %}

Use the **Filter By** panel to find and focus on specific pupils. E.g.:

* Boys or girls.
* Who has a birthday this week.
* Who receives free school meals.
* Who receives Pupil Premium.

By default, we hide the **Filter By** panel. To open the **Filter By** panel, click the **Filter** {% include icon.html url="filter" title="Filter" %} button on the toolbar.

{% include faq.html explain="Flagged pupil information" %}

The **Pupil Info Flags** call attention to certain children. E.g.:

* Who has a medical condition.
* Who has SEND needs.
* Who has **Pinned Notes** on their [**Pupil Log**](../plog/).
* Who has a **Quick Note** on their Pupil Record.

Clicking on a flag reveals more details:

By default, we hide the **Pupil Info Flags**. To see the **Pupil Info Flags**, change the **Privacy** setting from **Hide Pupil Info** to **Show Pupil Info** on the toolbar.

> Don't forget to turn the **Pupil Info Flags** off when using the Class Log on a whiteboard.

{% include faq.html explain="Getting more pupil information" %}

Clicking on a pupilâ€™s name reveals the **Pupil Additional Info** panel. The **Pupil Additional Info** panel provides more details about them, e.g., their date of birth, achievement and behaviour summary.

From **Pupil Additional Info** panel, you can jump out to other screens in SIMS to find out even more information about the pupil. E.g., their **Pupil Record**, their [**Pupil Log**](../plog/).

{% include faq.html explain="Sorting your class" %}

You can sort the pupils in your class by ascending or descending order on their:

* Name
* Age
* Good or bad behaviour

To apply sorting to your class, open the **Sort By** panel and choose from the sorting options.
